	<p>This is Henry! I'm currently a graduate student at <i class="fa fa-university" aria-hidden="true"></i><a href="https://www.bupt.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications</a>. I'm documenting my learning notes in this blog. Send me an <a href="mailto:Mr.fanghl@outlook.com">email</a> if you have questions or find errors. Thanks :)</p>

	<!-- <p>I used to be good at responding to emails, but <b>NOT any more</b> ... sorry. Time of one person is limited ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.</p>
	
	<p>Here are a selection of papers of mine that I especially like:
		<ol>
		<li>OpenAI, et al. <a href="{{ '/assets/papers/solving-rubiks-cube.pdf' | relative_url }}">Solving Rubik's Cube with a Robot Hand."</a> arXiv:1910.07113 (2019).</li>
		<li>OpenAI, et al. <a href="{{ '/assets/papers/learning-dexterity.pdf' | relative_url }}">Learning dexterous in-hand manipulation."</a> arXiv:1808.00177 (2018).</li>
		</ol>
	</p> -->

	<p>Fun fact: my name in Chinese pinyin is "Honglin", means a large forest, which sounds like Henry's pronunciation.</p>
